## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Type Definitions (`src/types/CastTypes.ts`)
```typescript
export type CastType = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  role: string;
  imageUrl: string | null;
  bio?: string;
  birthDate?: string;
  nationality?: string;
};

export type CastInputType = {
  name: string;
  role: string;
  bio?: string;
  birthDate?: string;
  nationality?: string;
  image: File | null;
};

export type CastSelectionType = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  role: string;
  imageUrl: string | null;
};
```

### API Integration

2. Add to admin navigation/routing
3. Ensure API endpoints are configured

### Using Cast Selection in Forms
```typescript
import { CastSelector } from "@/components/admin/casts";

// In your component
const [selectedCasts, setSelectedCasts] = useState<CastSelectionType[]>([]);

// In your form
<CastSelector
  selectedCasts={selectedCasts}
  onCastChange={setSelectedCasts}
/>
```

## 🧪 Testing with Mock Data
Mock data is provided in `src/data/mockCasts.ts` for testing purposes. It includes various cast members with different roles (Actor, Director, Composer, etc.).
